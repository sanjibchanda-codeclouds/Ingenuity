          <p>4.2.2. the Company shall not be liable for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by the Client arising directly or indirectly from the Company’s failure or delay to perform any of its obligations as set out in this condition 4.2; and</p>

          <p>5.1.2. for the avoidance of doubt, the Company reserves the right to fix the prices for the provision of the Services; and</p>

          <p>5.1.5. all Charges are payable as per the Quotation and payment shall be made in full by the Client.</p>

Where the Company does not elect to terminate the Contract in accordance with this condition 5.2, the Company shall provide the Services for the fee rates set out in the Quotation and no increase shall apply.</p>
            
            
          <p>5.3.

          <p>5.4. All location shoots are subject to weather conditions which are outside the Company’s control.

Where any taxable supply for VAT purposes is made under the Contract by the Company to the Client, the Client shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from the Company, pay to the Company such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of the Services at the same time as payment is due for the supply of the Services.</p>

          <p>5.9. Where the Services include the provision of Models and/or use of Locations, the Company shall, upon acceptance of the Order (in accordance with condition 2.2 above), make such payments and/or pay any such fees required to provide such Models and/or Locations in respect of the Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to procure Models and/or Locations or liable for any additional fees incurred for further usage in respect of the Services other than as set out in the Quotation or otherwise agreed between the parties in writing. The Client shall indemnify the Company against all fees, expenses, cancellation charges and other costs incurred by the Company in respect of such Models and/or Locations.

            <p>14.1.3. If the Force Majeure Event prevents the Company from providing any of the Services for more than 3 weeks, the Company shall, without limiting its other rights or remedies, have the right to terminate this Contract immediately by giving written notice to the Client.</p>
            
            
            <p>14.2. Assignment and subcontracting:</p>
            
            
            <p>14.2.1. The Company may at any time assign, transfer, charge, subcontract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights under the Contract and may subcontract or delegate in any manner any or all of its obligations under the Contract to any third party or agent.</p>

No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.</p>

            <p>14.5.2. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision of the Contract would be valid, enforceable and legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable.</p>
            
            
            <p>14.6.

            <p>14.10. Governing law and jurisdiction: This Contract, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law, and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
